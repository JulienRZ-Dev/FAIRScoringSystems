   <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Modeling by columns</h1>

   
   
   <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Java methods support modeling by columns in this example
of a Java application of CPLEX.</p>

      <p class="p">While for many examples population by rows may seem most
straightforward and natural, there are some models where population
by columns is a more natural or more efficient approach to implement.
For example, problems with network structure typically lend themselves
well to modeling by column. Readers familiar with matrix algebra may
view the method <code class="ph codeph">populateByColumn</code> as producing
the transpose of what is produced by the method <code class="ph codeph">populateByRow</code> .
In contrast to modeling by rows, modeling by columns means that the
coefficients of the constraint matrix are given in a column-wise way.
As each column represents the constraint coefficients for a given
variable in the linear program, this modeling approach is most natural
where it is easy to access the matrix coefficients by iterating through
all the variables, such as in network flow problems.</p>

      <p class="p">Range objects are created for modeling by column with
only their lower and upper bound. No expressions are given; building
them at this point would be impossible since the variables have not
been created yet. Similarly, the objective function is created only
with its intended optimization sense, and without any expression. </p>

      <p class="p">Next the variables are created and installed in the existing ranges and objective. These newly
created variables are introduced into the ranges and the objective by means of column objects, which
are implemented in the class <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html">IloColumn</a>. Objects of this class are created with the methods
<span class="keyword apiname">IloCplex.column(ilog.concert.IloLPMatrix lp)</span>, and can be linked together with the
method <span class="keyword apiname">IloColumn.and(ilog.concert.IloColumn column)</span> to form aggregate <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html">IloColumn</a> objects.</p>

      <p class="p">An instance of <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html">IloColumn</a> created with the method <span class="keyword apiname">IloCplex.column(ilog.concert.IloLPMatrix
lp)</span> contains information about how to use this column to introduce a new variable into an
existing modeling object. For example, if <code class="ph codeph">obj</code> is an instance of a class that
implements the interface <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloObjective.html">IloObjective</a>, then <code class="ph codeph">cplex.column(obj, 2.0)</code> creates an instance of <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html">IloColumn</a> containing the information to install a new variable in the expression of the <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloObjective.html">IloObjective</a> object <code class="ph codeph">obj</code> with a linear coefficient of <code class="ph codeph">2.0</code>.
Similarly, for <code class="ph codeph">rng</code>, a constraint that is an instance of a class that implements the
interface <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloRange.html">IloRange</a>, the invocation of the method <code class="ph codeph">cplex.column(rng, -1.0)</code> creates an <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html">IloColumn</a> object containing the information to install a new variable into the expression
of <code class="ph codeph">rng</code> , as a linear term with coefficient <code class="ph codeph">-1.0</code>.</p>

      <p class="p">When you use the approach of modeling by column, new columns are created and installed as
variables in all existing modeling objects where they are needed. To do this with Concert
Technology, you create an <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html">IloColumn</a> object for every modeling object in which you want to install a new variable, and
link them together with the method <code class="ph codeph">IloColumn.and(ilog.concert.IloColumn column)</code>.
For example, the first variable in <code class="ph codeph">populateByColumn</code> is created like this:</p>

      <p class="p">The three methods <code class="ph codeph">model.column</code> create <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html">IloColumn</a> objects for
installing a new variable in the objective <code class="ph codeph">obj</code> and
in the constraints <code class="ph codeph">r0</code> and <code class="ph codeph">r1</code>,
with linear coefficients <code class="ph codeph">1.0</code> , <code class="ph codeph">-1.0</code>,
and <code class="ph codeph">1.0</code>, respectively. They are all linked
to an aggregate column object by the method <code class="ph codeph">and</code>.
This aggregate column object is passed as the first argument to the
method <code class="ph codeph">numVar</code>, along with the bounds <code class="ph codeph">0.0</code> and <code class="ph codeph">40.0</code> as
the other two arguments. The method <code class="ph codeph">numVar</code> now
creates a new variable and immediately installs it in the modeling
objects <code class="ph codeph">obj</code>, <code class="ph codeph">r0</code>,
and <code class="ph codeph">r1</code> as defined by the aggregate column
object. After it has been installed, the new variable is returned
and stored in <code class="ph codeph">var[0][0]</code>.</p>
