   <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX offers means to modify the model and re-optimize,
using available information from previous optimizations.</p>

      <p class="p">In many situations, the solution to a model is only the
first step. One of the important features of Concert Technology is
the ability to modify and then re-solve the model even after it has
been extracted and solved one or more times.</p>

      <p class="p">A look back to examples <code class="ph codeph">ilolpex1.cpp</code> and <code class="ph codeph">ilolpex2.cpp</code> reveals that models have been modified
all along. Each time an extractable object is added to a model, it
changes the model. However, those examples made all such changes before
the model was extracted to CPLEX.</p>

      <p class="p">Concert Technology maintains a link between the model
and all <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html">IloCplex</a> 
objects that may have extracted it. This link is known as <em class="ph i">notification</em>.
Each time a modification of the model or one of its extractable objects
occurs, the <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex</code> objects that extracted
the model are notified about the change. They then track the modification
in their internal representations.</p>

      <p class="p">Moreover, <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html">IloCplex</a> 
tries to maintain as much information from a previous solution as
is possible and reasonable, when the model is modified, in order to
have a better start when solving the modified model. In particular,
when solving LPs or QPs with a simplex method, <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex</code> attempts
to maintain a basis which will be used the next time the method <a class="xref logicalApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#method_solve">solve</a> is
invoked, with the aim of making subsequent solves go faster.</p>
