<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Your Callable Library application initializes the CPLEX
environment.</p>

<p class="p">CPLEX requires a number of internal data structures in order to execute properly. These data
structures must be initialized before any call to the CPLEX Callable Library. The first call to the
CPLEX Callable Library is always to the routine <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/openCPLEX.html" title="The routine CPXXopenCPLEX/CPXopenCPLEX initializes a CPLEX environment.">CPXopenCPLEX</a></code>. This
routine returns a pointer to the CPLEX environment. This pointer is then passed to nearly every
CPLEX Callable Library routine (for example, <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/msgstr.html" title="The routine CPXXmsgstr/CPXmsgstr sends a character string to a CPLEX message channel.">CPXXmsgstr and CPXmsgstr</a></code> is an exception).</p>

<p class="p">The application developer must make an independent decision as
to whether the variable containing the environment pointer is a global
or local variable. Multiple environments are allowed, but extensive
opening and closing of environments may create significant overhead
and degrade performance; typical applications make use of only one
environment for the entire execution, since a single environment may
hold as many problem objects as the user wants. After all calls to
the Callable Library are complete, the environment is released by
the routine <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/closeCPLEX.html" title="This routine frees all of the data structures associated with CPLEX.">CPXcloseCPLEX</a></code>.
 This routine specifies to CPLEX that all calls to the Callable Library
are complete, any memory allocated by CPLEX is returned to the operating
system, and the use of CPLEX is ended for this run.</p>
