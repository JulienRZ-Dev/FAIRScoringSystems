<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents preprocessing at default parameter settings
in LP optimizers.</p>

<p class="p">At default settings, CPLEX preprocesses problems by simplifying
constraints, reducing problem size, and eliminating redundancy. Its
presolver tries to reduce the size of a problem by making inferences
about the nature of any optimal solution to the problem. Its aggregator
tries to eliminate variables and rows through substitution. For most
models, preprocessing is beneficial to the total solution speed, and
CPLEX reports the model's solution in terms of the user's original
formulation, making the exact nature of any reductions immaterial.</p>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.664530__User_manual.uss_solveLP.664641"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Dual formulation in presolve</h2><p class="p">A useful preprocessing feature for performance tuning,
one that is not always activated by default, can be to convert the
problem to its dual formulation. The nature of the dual formulation
is rooted in linear programming theory, beyond the scope of this manual,
but for the purposes of this preprocessing feature it is sufficient
to think of the roles of the rows and columns of the model's constraint
matrix as being switched. Thus the feature is especially applicable
to models that have many more rows than columns. </p>
<p class="p">You can direct the preprocessor to form the dual by setting
the <code class="ph codeph">PreDual</code> parameter to <code class="ph codeph">1</code> (one). </p>
<p class="p">Conversely, to entirely inhibit the dual formulation
for the barrier optimizer, you can set the <code class="ph codeph">PreDual</code> parameter
to <code class="ph codeph">-1</code> . The default, automatic, setting
is <code class="ph codeph">0</code> .</p>
<p class="p">It is worth emphasizing, to those familiar with linear
programming theory, that the decision to solve the dual formulation
of your model, via this preprocessing parameter, is not the same as
the choice between using the dual simplex method or the primal simplex
method to perform the optimization. Although these two concepts (dual
formulation and dual simplex optimizer) have theoretical foundations
in common, it is valid to consider, for example, solving the dual
formulation of your model with the dual simplex method; this would
not simply result in the same computational path as solving the primal
formulation with the primal simplex method. However, with that distinction
as background, it may be worth knowing that when CPLEX generates the
dual formulation, and a simplex optimizer is to be used, CPLEX will
in most cases automatically select the opposite simplex optimizer
to the one it would have selected for the primal formulation. Thus,
if you set the <code class="ph codeph">PreDual</code> parameter to 1 (one),
and also select <code class="ph codeph">LPMethod</code> 1 (which normally
invokes the primal simplex optimizer), the dual simplex optimizer
will be used in solving the dual formulation. Because solution status
and the other results of an optimization are the same regardless of
these settings, no additional steps need to be taken by the user to
use and interpret the solution; but examination of solution logs might
prove confusing if this behavior is not taken into account.</p>

strengthens problem reduction by detecting redundant constraints.

a reverse operation (uncrush) occurs at termination to restore the
full model with its solution. With default settings, the simplex optimizers
will perform a final basis factorization on the full model before
terminating. If you turn on the memory emphasis parameter (<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/MemoryEmphasis.html" title="Directs CPLEX that it should conserve memory where possible.">memory reduction switch</a>: <code class="ph codeph">MemoryEmphasis
(bool)</code>, <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MEMORYEMPHASIS (int)</code>)
to conserve memory, the final factorization after uncrushing will
be skipped; on large models this can save some time, but computations
that require a factorized basis after optimization (for example the
computation of the condition number Kappa) may be unavailable depending
on the operations presolve performed.</p>
<p class="p">Factorization can easily be performed later by a call
to a simplex optimizer with the parameter <code class="ph codeph">AdvInd</code> set
to a value greater than or equal to one.</p>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.664530__User_manual.uss_solveLP.672030"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Memory use and presolve</h2><p class="p">To reduce memory use, presolve may compress the arrays
used for storage of the original model. This compression can make
more memory available for the optimizer that the user has called.
To conserve memory, you can also turn on the memory emphasis parameter
(<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/MemoryEmphasis.html" title="Directs CPLEX that it should conserve memory where possible.">memory reduction switch</a>: <code class="ph codeph">MemoryEmphasis

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.664530__User_manual.uss_solveLP.672037"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Controlling passes in preprocessing</h2><p class="p">In rare instances, a user may wish to specify the number
of analysis passes that the presolver or the aggregator makes through
the problem. The parameters <code class="ph codeph">PrePass</code> and <code class="ph codeph">AggInd</code> ,
respectively, control these two preprocessing features; the default, <code class="ph codeph">automatic</code> ,
setting of <code class="ph codeph">-1</code> lets CPLEX decide the number
of passes to make, while a setting of <code class="ph codeph">0</code> directs
CPLEX not to use that preprocessing feature, and a positive integer
limits the number of passes to that value. At the automatic setting,
CPLEX applies the aggregator just once when it is solving the LP model;
for some problems, it may be worthwhile to increase the <code class="ph codeph">AggInd</code> setting.
The behavior under the <code class="ph codeph">PrePass</code> default
is less easy to predict, but if the output log indicates it is performing
excessive analysis, you may wish to try a limit of five passes or
some other modest value.</p>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.664530__User_manual.uss_solveLP.672038"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Aggregator fill in preprocessing</h2><p class="p">Another parameter, which affects only the aggregator,
is <code class="ph codeph">AggFill</code>. Occasionally the substitutions
made by the aggregator will increase matrix density and thus make
each iteration too expensive to be advantageous. In such cases, try
lowering <code class="ph codeph">AggFill</code> from its default value
of <code class="ph codeph">10</code>. CPLEX may make fewer substitutions
as a consequence, and the resulting problem will be less dense.</p>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.664530__User_manual.uss_solveLP.672043"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Turning off preprocessing</h2><p class="p">Finally, if for some reason you wish to turn CPLEX preprocessing
entirely off, set the parameter <code class="ph codeph">PreInd</code> to
0 (zero).</p>
