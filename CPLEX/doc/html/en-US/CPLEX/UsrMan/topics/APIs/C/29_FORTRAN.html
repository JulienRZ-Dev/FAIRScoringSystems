<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes coding conventions of the C API to support
interface with a FORTRAN application.</p>

<p class="p">The Callable Library can be interfaced with FORTRAN applications.
Although they are no longer distributed with the product, you can
download examples of a FORTRAN application from the technotes of the product support
web site. At the portal of your product, search for CPLEX and FORTRAN 
to locate relevant technotes, such as "Calling CPLEX from FORTRAN" 
or "Calling CPLEX C API from Fortran using Open Watcom" </p>

<p class="p">Those examples were compiled with CPLEX versions 7.0
and earlier on a particular platform. Since C-to-FORTRAN interfaces
vary across platforms (operating system, hardware, compilers, etc.),
you may need to modify the examples for your own system.</p>

<p class="p">Whether you need intermediate routines for the interface
depends on your operating system. As a first step in building such
an interface, it is a good idea to study your system documentation
about C-to-FORTRAN interfaces. In that context, this section lists
a few considerations particular to CPLEX in building a FORTRAN interface.</p>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639197__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639204"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Case-sensitivity</h2><p class="p">As you know, FORTRAN is a case-insensitive language,
whereas routines in the Callable Library have names with mixed case.
Most FORTRAN compilers have an option, such as the option <code class="ph codeph">-U</code> 
on UNIX systems, that treats symbols in a case-sensitive way. It is
a good idea to use this option in any file that calls Callable Library
routines.</p>
<p class="p">On some operating systems, certain intrinsic FORTRAN
functions must be in all upper case (that is, capital letters) for
the compiler to accept those functions.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639197__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639205"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Underscore</h2><p class="p">On some systems, all FORTRAN external symbols are created
with an underscore character (that is, _) added to the end of the
symbol name. Some systems have an option to turn off this feature.
If you are able to turn off those postpended underscores, you may
not need other “glue” routines.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639197__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639206"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Six-character identifiers</h2><p class="p">FORTRAN 77 allows identifiers that are unique only
up to six characters. However, in practice, most FORTRAN compilers
allow you to exceed this limit. Since routines in the Callable Library
have names greater than six characters, you need to verify whether
your FORTRAN compiler enforces this limit or allows longer identifiers.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639197__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639207"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Call by reference</h2><p class="p">By default, FORTRAN passes arguments by reference; that
is, the <em class="ph i">address</em> of
a variable is passed to a routine, not its value. In contrast, many
routines of the Callable Library require arguments passed by value.
To accommodate those routines, most FORTRAN compilers have the VMS
FORTRAN extension <code class="ph codeph">%VAL()</code> . This operator
used in calls to external functions or subroutines causes its argument
to be passed by value (rather than by the default FORTRAN convention
of passed by reference). For example, with that extension, you can
call the routine <code class="ph codeph">CPXprimopt</code>  with this
FORTRAN statement:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
status = CPXprimopt (%val(env), %val(lp))
</code></pre></section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639197__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639260"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pointers</h2><p class="p">Certain CPLEX routines return a pointer to memory. In FORTRAN 77, such a pointer cannot be
de-referenced; however, you can store its value in an appropriate integer type, and you can then
pass it to other CPLEX routines.  On 64-bit operating systems, a variable of type
<code class="ph codeph">INTEGER*8</code> may be needed. Consult your system documentation to learn the appropriate
integer type to hold variables that are C pointers.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639197__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.639210"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Strings</h2><p class="p">When you pass strings to routines of the Callable Library,
they expect C strings; that is, strings terminated by an ASCII <code class="ph codeph">NULL</code> character,
denoted <code class="ph codeph">\0</code> in C. Consequently, when you
pass a FORTRAN string, you must add a terminating <code class="ph codeph">NULL</code> character;
you do so by means of the FORTRAN intrinsic function <code class="ph codeph">CHAR(0)</code> .</p>
