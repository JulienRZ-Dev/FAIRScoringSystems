platforms.</p>

<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Linking with the shared library</h2>

<p class="p">To statically link a binary with CPLEX, the following command line arguments are used in the link
step: </p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> -L$COSDIR/cplex/lib/$SYSTEM/$FORMAT -lcplex</code></pre>
<p class="p">Here we assume that <code class="ph codeph">$COSDIR</code> is the directory into which COS was installed and
<code class="ph codeph">$SYSTEM/$FORMAT</code> is something such as <code class="ph codeph">x86-64_linux/static_pic</code>,
which indicates your platform. The <code class="ph codeph">-L</code> option tells the linker where to look for
CPLEX libraries and the <code class="ph codeph">-l</code> option tells the linker which library to use
(<code class="ph codeph">libcplex.a</code> in this example).  </p>

<p class="p">For linking with the dynamic library the arguments change to:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> -L$COSDIR/cplex/bin/$SYSTEM -lcplex$VERSION</code></pre>
<p class="p">There are two differences compared to the previous arguments used to link statically:</p>

<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">The dynamic library is located in the <code class="ph codeph">bin</code> directory instead of the
<code class="ph codeph">lib</code> directory. The name of the directory does not include the
<code class="ph codeph">$FORMAT</code> name.</li>

<li class="li">The name of the library contains the current CPLEX version number, such as <code class="ph codeph">1290</code>
(for CPLEX V.12.9.0).</li>

</ol>

<p class="p">All other options for the linker do not differ between static and dynamic linking.</p>

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Note that the CPLEX shared library has a constructor and a destructor. Executing these during
load/unload is mandatory or unspecified behavior will result. Usually the dynamic linker will do
that for you, but be careful not to use any linker options that prevent this.</div>

<p class="p">The name of the dynamic library depends on the operating system. For example, on Linux the
library is called <code class="ph codeph">libcplex$VERSION.so</code> and on macOS it is called
<code class="ph codeph">libcplex$VERSION.dylib</code>.</p>

</section>

<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Running a binary that was dynamically linked</h2>

<p class="p">When executing a binary that was dynamically linked against CPLEX, the dynamic linker must load
the CPLEX dynamic library. To be able to do so, it must be able to find it on disk.</p>

<p class="p">One common way to enable the linker to find the library is to configure the dynamic linker search
path environment variable. On macOS that variable is called <code class="ph codeph">DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and
on most other platforms (including Linux) it is called <code class="ph codeph">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. </p>

<p class="p">The CPLEX dynamic library is located in directory <code class="ph codeph">$COSDIR/cplex/bin/$SYSTEM</code>,
where <code class="ph codeph">$COSDIR</code> specifies the COS installation directory and <code class="ph codeph">$SYSTEM</code>
defines your architecture, such as <code class="ph codeph">x86-64_linux</code>. To change the dynamic library
search path in a bash shell on Linux issue these commands:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$COSDIR/cplex/bin/$SYSTEM
export LD_LIBRARY_PTH
./execute_your_binary</code></pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Note that many linkers also provide an option to add additional search paths to the binary
itself. This is useful if you know beforehand where the libraries will be located. These options are
frequently called <code class="ph codeph">rpath</code> or similar. Check the documentation of your (dynamic)
linker for further details.</div>
