<h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Primal and dual considerations in presolve reductions</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes modifications that impact primal and dual formulations.</p>

<p class="p">Presolve reductions can be classified into several groups:
those that rely on primal information, those that rely on dual information,
and those that rely on both. Addition of new constraints, modifications
to objective coefficients, and tightening of variable bounds (a special
case of adding new constraints) require the user to turn off dual
reductions. Introduction of new columns, modifications to righthand-side
values, and relaxation of variable bounds (a special case of modifying
righthand-side values) require the user to turn off primal reductions. </p>

<p class="p">These reductions are controlled through the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/Reduce.html" title="Specifies whether primal reductions, dual reductions, both, or neither are performed during preprocessing.">primal and dual reduction type</a> (<code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code>) parameter. The parameter has four
possible settings. The default value <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PREREDUCE_PRIMALANDDUAL</code>  (3) indicates that presolve can rely on primal and dual information.
With setting <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PREREDUCE_DUALONLY</code>  (2),
presolve only uses dual information, with setting <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PREREDUCE_PRIMALONLY</code>  (1) it only uses primal information, and with setting <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PREREDUCE_NO_PRIMALORDUAL</code>  (0) it uses neither
(which is equivalent to turning presolve off).</p>

<p class="p">Setting the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/Reduce.html" title="Specifies whether primal reductions, dual reductions, both, or neither are performed during preprocessing.">primal and dual reduction type</a> (<code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code>) parameter has one additional effect
on the optimization. Normally, the presolved model and the presolved
solution are freed at the end of an optimization call. However, when <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code> is set to a value other than its default, CPLEX
assumes that the problem will subsequently be modified and reoptimized.
It therefore retains the presolved model and any presolved solution
information (internally to the LP problem object). If the user has
set <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code> and is finished with
problem modification, the user can call <code class="ph codeph">CPXfreepresolve</code>  to free the presolved model and reclaim the associated memory.
The presolved model is automatically freed when the user calls <code class="ph codeph">CPXfreeprob</code>  on the original problem.</p>
