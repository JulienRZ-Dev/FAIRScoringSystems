<h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Manual control of presolve</h1>



<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes features to control presolve.</p>

<p class="p">While presolve was a highly automated and transparent procedure
in releases of CPLEX prior to 7.0, releases after 7.0  give the user
significant control over when presolve is performed and what is done
with the result. This section discusses these added control facilities.
The routines mentioned here are documented in detail, including arguments
and return values, in the <em class="ph i">Callable Library Reference Manual</em>.</p>

<p class="p">The first control function provided by the advanced presolve interface
is <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/presolve.html" title="The routine CPXXpresolve/CPXpresolve performs LP or MIP presolve depending whether a problem object is an LP or a MIP.">CPXpresolve</a></code>,
 which manually invokes presolve on the supplied problem. After this
routine is called on a problem, the original problem has a <em class="ph i">presolved
model</em> associated with it. Subsequent calls to optimization routines
(<code class="ph codeph">CPXprimopt</code>, <code class="ph codeph">CPXdualopt</code>, <code class="ph codeph">CPXbaropt</code>, <code class="ph codeph">CPXmipopt</code>)
will use this presolved model without repeating the presolve, provided
no operation that discards the presolved model is performed in the
interim. The presolved model is automatically discarded if a problem
modification is performed that is incompatible with the setting of
the parameter <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code>, documented in <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/Reduce.html" title="Specifies whether primal reductions, dual reductions, both, or neither are performed during preprocessing.">primal and dual reduction type</a>.
(Further information about this point appears in <a class="xref" href="12_modify_prob.html" title="Describes conditions in which to modify a model after presolve.">Modifying a problem</a>.)</p>

<p class="p">By using the parameter <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code> to restrict
the types of presolve reductions, CPLEX can make use of the optimal
basis of the presolved model. If you set <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code> to
restrict presolve reductions, then make problem modifications that
don’t invalidate those reductions, CPLEX will automatically use the
optimal basis of the presolved model. On the other hand, if the nature
of the problem modifications is such that you cannot set <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code>,
you can still perform an advanced start by making the modifications,
then calling <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/presolve.html" title="The routine CPXXpresolve/CPXpresolve performs LP or MIP presolve depending whether a problem object is an LP or a MIP.">CPXpresolve</a></code> to
create the new presolved model, then calling <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/copystart.html" title="This routine provides starting information for use in a subsequent call to a simplex optimization routine.">CPXcopystart</a></code>,
passing the original model and any combination of primal and dual
solutions. With nondefault settings of the parameter <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code> <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/Reduce.html" title="Specifies whether primal reductions, dual reductions, both, or neither are performed during preprocessing.">primal and dual reduction type</a> ,
CPLEX will crush the solutions and use them to construct a starting
basis for the presolved model. If you are continuing with primal simplex,
only providing a primal starting vector will usually perform better. </p>

<p class="p">There are subtleties associated with using <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/copystart.html" title="This routine provides starting information for use in a subsequent call to a simplex optimization routine.">CPXcopystart</a></code> to
start an optimization from an advanced, presolved solution. This routine
creates a presolved solution vector only if the presolved model is
already present (either because the user called <code class="ph codeph">CPXpresolve</code> or
because the user turned off some presolve reductions through <code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</code> and
then solved a problem). The earlier sequence would not have started
from an advanced solution if <code class="ph codeph">CPXcopystart</code>  had been
called before <code class="ph codeph">CPXpresolve</code>. Another important detail
about <code class="ph codeph">CPXcopystart</code> is that it crushes primal and/or
dual solutions, not bases. It then uses the crushed solutions to choose
a starting basis. If you have a basis, you need to compute optimal
primal and dual solutions (using <code class="ph codeph">CPXcopybase</code> and
then <code class="ph codeph">CPXprimopt</code>), extract them, and then call <code class="ph codeph">CPXcopystart</code> with
them to use the corresponding advanced solution. In general, starting
with both a primal and dual solution is preferable to starting with
one or the other. One other thing to note about <code class="ph codeph">CPXcopystart</code> is
that the primal and dual slack (<samp class="ph msgph">slack</samp> and <samp class="ph msgph">dj</samp>)
arguments are optional. The routine will compute slack values if none
are provided.</p>

<p class="p">You can set the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/AdvInd.html" title="If set to 1 or 2, this parameter specifies that CPLEX should use advanced starting information when it initiates optimization.">advanced start switch</a> (<code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_ADVIND</code>)
to 2 in order to use advanced starting information together with presolve.
At this setting, CPLEX will use starting information provided to it
with <code class="ph codeph">CPXcopystart</code> or <code class="ph codeph">CPXcopybase</code> when
it solves an LP with the primal or dual simplex optimizer in the following
way. If no presolved model is available, presolve is invoked. Then
the starting information is crushed and installed in the presolved
model. Finally, the presolved model is solved from the advanced (crushed)
starting point.</p>

<p class="p">Another situation where a user might want to use <code class="ph codeph">CPXpresolve</code> is
if the user wants to gather information about the presolve, possibly
in preparation for using the advanced MIP callback routines to control
branch &amp; cut. After <code class="ph codeph">CPXpresolve</code> has been called,
the user can then call <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/getprestat.html" title="The routine CPXXgetprestat/CPXgetprestat accesses presolve status information for the columns and rows of the presolved problem in the original problem and of the original problem in the presolved problem.">CPXgetprestat</a></code> to
obtain information about the reductions performed on the problem.
This routine provides information, for each variable in the original
problem, about whether the variable was fixed and removed, aggregated
out, removed for some other reason, or is still present in the reduced
model. It also gives information, for each row in the original problem,
about whether it was removed due to redundancy, aggregated out, or
is still present in the reduced model. For those rows and columns
that are present in the reduced model, this function provides a mapping
from original row/column number to row/column number in the reduced
model, and vice-versa.</p>

<p class="p">Another situation where a user might want to use <code class="ph codeph">CPXpresolve</code> is
to work directly on the presolved model.  By calling <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/getredlp.html" title="The routine CPXXgetredlp/CPXgetredlp returns a pointer for the presolved problem.">CPXgetredlp</a></code> immediately
after <code class="ph codeph">CPXpresolve</code>,  the user can obtain a pointer
to the presolved model. As an example of how this pointer might be
used, the user could call routines <code class="ph codeph">CPXcrushx</code> and <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/crushpi.html" title="The routine CPXXcrushpi/CPXcrushpi crushes a dual solution for the original problem to a dual solution for the presolved problem.">CPXcrushpi</a></code> to
presolve primal and dual solution vectors, then call <code class="ph codeph">CPXgetredlp</code> 
to get access to the presolved model, then use <code class="ph codeph">CPXcopystart</code> to
copy the presolved solutions into the presolved model, then optimize
the problem, and finally call the routines <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/uncrushx.html" title="The routine CPXXuncrushx/CPXuncrushx uncrushes a solution for the presolved problem to the solution for the original problem.">CPXuncrushx</a></code> and <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/uncrushpi.html" title="The routine CPXXuncrushpi/CPXuncrushpi uncrushes a dual solution for the presolved problem to a dual solution for the original problem.">CPXuncrushpi</a></code> (<code class="ph codeph">CPXqpuncrushpi</code> 
for QPs) to unpresolve solutions from the presolved model, creating
solutions for the original problem.</p>

<p class="p">The routine <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/getredlp.html" title="The routine CPXXgetredlp/CPXgetredlp returns a pointer for the presolved problem.">CPXgetredlp</a></code> 
provides the user access to internal CPLEX data structures. The presolved
model must not be modified by the user. If the user wants to manipulate
the reduced problem, the user should make a copy of it (using <code class="ph codeph">CPXcloneprob</code>)
and manipulate the copy instead.</p>

<p class="p">The advanced presolve interface provides another call that is useful
when working directly with the presolved model (either through <code class="ph codeph">CPXgetredlp</code> or
through the advanced MIP callbacks). The call to <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/crushform.html" title="The routineCPXcrushform crushes a linear formula of the original problem to a linear formula of the presolved problem.">CPXcrushform</a></code> translates
a linear expression in the original problem into a linear expression
in the presolved model. The most likely use of this routine is to
add user cuts to the presolved model during a mixed integer optimization.
The advanced presolve interface also provides the reverse operation.
The routine <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/uncrushform.html" title="The routine CPXXuncrushform/CPXuncrushform uncrushes a linear formula of the presolved problem to a linear formula of the original problem.">CPXuncrushform</a></code> translates
a linear expression in the presolved model into a linear expression
in the original problem.</p>

<p class="p">A limited presolve analysis is performed by <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/basicpresolve.html" title="The routine CPXXbasicpresolve/CPXbasicpresolve performs bound strengthening and detects redundant rows.">CPXbasicpresolve</a></code> and
by the Concert Technology method <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex::basicPresolve</code> .
This routine detects which rows are redundant and computes strengthened
bounds on the variables. This information can be used to derive some
types of cuts that will tighten the formulation, to aid in formulation
by pointing out redundancies, and to provide upper bounds for variables. <code class="ph codeph">CPXbasicpresolve</code> does
not create a presolved model. </p>

<p class="p">The interface allows the user to manually free the memory associated
with the presolved model using the routine <code class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/freepresolve.html" title="The routine CPXXfreepresolve/CPXfreepresolve frees the presolved problem from the LP problem object.">CPXfreepresolve</a></code>.
The next optimization call (or call to <code class="ph codeph">CPXpresolve</code>)
 re-creates the presolved model.</p>
