<h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Memory management and goals</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes goals in the context of memory management.</p>

<p class="p">Java and .NET use garbage collection to handle all memory
management issues. Thus the following applies only to the C++ library.
Java or .NET users may safely skip ahead to <a class="xref" href="19_cuts.html" title="Distinguishes local cuts from global cuts and illustrates cuts added by a goal">Cuts and goals</a>.</p>

<p class="p">To conserve memory, in the C++ API, CPLEX only stores
active nodes of the tree and deletes nodes as soon as they become
inactive. When deleting nodes, CPLEX also deletes the goal stacks
associated with them, including all goals they may still contain.
In other words, CPLEX takes over memory management for goals.</p>

<p class="p">It does so by keeping track of how many references to
every goal are in use. As soon as this number drops to zero (0), the
goal is automatically deleted. This technique is known as reference
counting.</p>

<p class="p">CPLEX implements reference counting in the handle class <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex::Goal</code>.
Every <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI</code> object maintains
a count of how many <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex::Goal</code> handle
objects refer to it. The assignment operator, the constructors, and
the destructor of class <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex::Goal</code> are
implemented in such a way as to keep the reference count up-to-date.
This convention means that users should always access goals through
handle objects, rather than keeping their own pointers to implementation
objects.</p>

<p class="p">Other than that, nothing special needs to be observed
when dealing with goals. In particular, goals don't have <code class="ph codeph">end</code> methods
like other handle classes in the C++ API of Concert Technology. Instead,
CPLEX goal objects are automatically deleted when no more references
to them exist.</p>

<p class="p">Local cut goals contain <code class="ph codeph">IloRange</code> objects.
Since the <code class="ph codeph">IloRange</code> object is only applied
when the goal is executed, the method <code class="ph codeph">end</code> must
not be called for a range constraint from which a local cut goal is
built. The goal will take over memory management for the constraints
and call the method <code class="ph codeph">end</code> when the goal itself
is destroyed. Also, an <code class="ph codeph">IloRange</code> object
can only be used in exactly one local cut goal. Similarly, method <code class="ph codeph">end</code> must
not be called for <code class="ph codeph">IloRangeArray</code> objects
that are passed to local cut goals. Also such arrays must not contain
duplicate elements.</p>

<p class="p">Going back to the example <code class="ph codeph">ilogoalex1.cpp</code>,
you see that the method <code class="ph codeph">end</code> is called for
the temporary arrays <code class="ph codeph">x</code>, <code class="ph codeph">obj</code>,
and <code class="ph codeph">feas</code> at the end of the <code class="ph codeph">execute</code> method.
Though a bit hidden, two <code class="ph codeph">IloRange</code> constraints
are constructed for the goal, corresponding to the arguments of the <code class="ph codeph">Or</code> goal.
CPLEX takes over memory management for these two constraints as soon
as they are enclosed in a goal. This takeover happens via the implicit
constructor <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex::Goal::Goal(IloRange rng)</code> that
is called when the range constraints are passed as arguments to the <code class="ph codeph">Or</code> 
goal.</p>

<p class="p">In summary, the user is responsible for calling <code class="ph codeph">end</code> 
on all Concert Technology objects created in a goal, except when they
have been passed as arguments to a new goal.</p>

<p class="p">Also, user code in the <code class="ph codeph">execute</code> method
is <strong class="ph b">not</strong> allowed to modify existing
Concert Technology objects in any way. CPLEX uses an optimized memory
management system within goals for dealing with temporary objects.
However, this memory management system cannot be mixed with the default
memory management system used by Concert Technology. Thus, for example,
it is illegal to add an element to array <code class="ph codeph">vars</code> in
the example, since this array has been created outside of the goal.</p>
