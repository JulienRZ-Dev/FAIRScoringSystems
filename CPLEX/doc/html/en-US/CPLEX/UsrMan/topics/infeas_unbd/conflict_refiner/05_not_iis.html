<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Distinguishes a conflict from an irreducibly inconsistent
set (IIS).</p>

<p class="p">In some ways a conflict resembles an irreducibly inconsistent set (IIS). Detection of an IIS
among the constraints of a model is a standard methodology in the published literature. Both the
CPLEX conflict refiner and the IIS methodology attempt to identify an infeasible subproblem of a
provably infeasible model.</p>

<p class="p">However, a conflict is more general than an IIS. The IIS methodology is applicable only to
continuous LP models, (including those obtained from a continuous QP by removing the quadratic
objective terms). In contrast, the conflict refiner is capable of doing its work on all continuous
and discrete problem types that CPLEX supports, except for those with explicit second order cone
constraints.</p>

<p class="p">Also, you can specify one or more <em class="ph i">groups</em> of constraints for a conflict; a group will
either be present together in the conflict, or else will not be part of it at all. </p>

<p class="p">You can also assign a numeric <em class="ph i">preference</em> to a constraint or to groups of constraints. In
the case of an infeasible model that has more than one possible conflict, the preferences you assign
will guide the tool toward detecting the conflict you want. Preferences allow you to specify aspects
of the model that may otherwise be difficult to encode.</p>

<p class="p">While the conflict refiner usually will deliver a smaller set of constraints to consider than
using the IIS methodology will, the methods are different enough that the reverse can sometimes be
true. In general, the conflict refiner can be thought of as usually doing everything the IIS
methodology can, and often more. In fact, you might think of the conflict refiner as an extension
and generalization of the IIS methodology.</p>
