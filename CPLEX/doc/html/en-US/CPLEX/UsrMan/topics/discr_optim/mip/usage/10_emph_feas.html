<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the context of the MIP emphasis parameter.</p>

<p class="p">The following topic, <a class="xref" href="../performance/12_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes features for tuning performance of the MIP optimizer.">Tuning performance features of the mixed integer optimizer</a>, goes
into great detail about the algorithmic features, controlled by parameter settings, that are
available in CPLEX to achieve performance tuning on difficult MIP models. However, there is an
important parameter, <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/MIPEmphasis.html" title="Controls trade-offs between speed, feasibility, optimality, and moving bounds in MIP.">MIP emphasis switch</a> (<code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> or
<code class="ph codeph">CPXPARAM_Emphasis_MIP</code>), that is oriented less toward the user understanding the
algorithm being used to solve the model, and more toward the user telling the algorithm something
about the underlying aim of the optimization being run. That parameter is discussed here. (Please
note that, prior to CPLEX V12.6.0, this parameter was named
<code class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MIPEMPHASIS</code>.)</p>

<p class="p">Optimizing a MIP model involves:</p>

<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">finding a succession of improving integer
feasible solutions (that is, solutions satisfying the linear and quadratic
constraints and the integrality conditions); while</p>

</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">also working toward a proof that no
better feasible solution exists and is undiscovered. </p>

</li>
</ol>

<p class="p">For most models, a balance between these two sometimes-competing
aims works well, and this is another way of stating the philosophy
behind the default <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code>  setting:
it balances optimality and integer feasibility.</p>

<p class="p">At this default <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> setting of <code class="ph codeph">0</code> (that is,
<code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisBalanced</code> in Concert Technology or
<code class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_BALANCED</code> in the Callable Library), CPLEX uses tactics intended to
find a proven optimal solution quickly, for models of a broad range of difficulty.  Branching is
performed in a manner that seeks to find good quality feasible solutions, without sacrificing too
much time that could be spent proving the optimality of any solution that has already been
found.</p>

<p class="p">In many situations, the user may want a greater emphasis on feasibility and less emphasis on
analysis and proof of optimality. For example, a restrictive time limit, set by the user with the
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/TiLim.html" title="Sets the maximum time, in seconds, for a call to an optimizer.">optimizer time limit in seconds</a>
(<code class="ph codeph">CPXPARAM_TimeLimit</code>) parameter, may be in force due to a real-time application
deployment, where a model is of sufficient difficulty that a proof of optimality is unlikely, and
the user wants to have simply as good a solution as is practicable when the time limit is reached.
The <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> setting of <code class="ph codeph">1</code>
(<code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisFeasibility</code> in Concert Technology or
<code class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_FEASIBILITY</code> in the Callable Library) directs CPLEX to adopt this
emphasis. Less computational effort is applied at the outset toward the analyses that aid in the
eventual proof of optimality, and more effort is spent in immediately beginning computations that
search for early (and then improved) feasible solutions. It is likely on most models that an
eventual proof of optimality would take longer by setting <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> to 1 , but
since the user has given CPLEX the additional information that this proof is of less importance than
usual, the user's needs will actually be met more effectively.</p>

<p class="p">Another choice for <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> is <code class="ph codeph">2</code> (<code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisOptimality</code> in
Concert Technology or, in the Callable Library, <code class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_OPTIMALITY</code>).
This setting results in a greater emphasis on optimality than on feasibility.
The search for feasible solutions is not ignored completely, but the
balance is shifted toward moving the Best Bound (described in the
following paragraph) more rapidly, at the likely expense of feasible
solutions being found less rapidly, and improved feasible solutions
less frequently, than with the default emphasis.</p>

<p class="p">The fourth choice for <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code>, <code class="ph codeph">3</code> (<code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisBestBound</code> in
Concert Technology or, in the Callable Library, <code class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_BESTBOUND</code>)
works exclusively at moving the <em class="ph i">Best
Bound</em>. The Best Bound represents the objective function
value at which an integer feasible solution could still potentially
exist. As possibilities are eliminated, this Best Bound value will
move in the opposite direction to that of any improving series of
integer feasible solutions. The process of moving the Best Bound will
eventually result in the optimal feasible solution being discovered,
at which point the optimization is complete, and feasible solutions
may be discovered along the way anyway, due to branches that happen
to locate feasible solutions that do not match the Best Bound. A great
deal of analysis may be performed on the model, beyond what is done
with the default emphasis. Therefore, it is recommended to use this
setting only on models that are difficult for the default emphasis,
and for which you do not care about interim feasible solutions that
may or may not be optimal.</p>

<p class="p">The fifth choice for <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> is 4
(<code class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_HIDDENFEAS</code>). It applies considerable additional effort toward
finding high quality feasible solutions that are difficult to locate, and for this reason the
eventual proof of optimality may take longer than with default settings. This choice is intended for
use on difficult models where a proof of optimality is unlikely, and where emphasis 1 (one) does not
deliver solutions of an appropriately high quality. </p>

<p class="p">The final choice for <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code>, 5 (<code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisHeuristic</code> in
Concert Technology or, in the Callable Library, <code class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_HEURISTIC</code>), works
exclusively at finding high quality feasible solutions as early as possible. A best bound is also
computed, but almost no effort is put into  proving optimality. This setting works even harder than
choice 4, (<code class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_HIDDENFEAS</code>), on finding high quality solutions, and
relies on a very aggressive usage of many primal heuristics. Therefore, it can be useful for cases
where even choice 4 has difficulty finding solutions of acceptable quality within the required
computing time.</p>

<p class="p">To make clear a point that has been alluded to so far:
every choice of <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> results in
the search algorithm proceeding in a manner that eventually will find
and prove an optimal solution, or will prove that no integer feasible
solution exists. The choice of emphasis only guides CPLEX to produce
feasible solutions in a way that is in keeping with the user's particular
purposes, but the accuracy and completeness of the algorithm is not
sacrificed in the process.</p>

<p class="p">The <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> parameter may be set in conjunction with any other CPLEX
parameters (discussed at length in the next section). For example, if you wish to set an upward
branching strategy via the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/BrDir.html" title="Decides which branch, the up or the down branch, should be taken first at each node.">MIP branching direction</a> (<code class="ph codeph">CPXPARAM_MIP_Strategy_Branch</code>)
parameter, this will be honored by any setting of <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code>. Of course, certain
combinations of <code class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</code> with other parameters may be counter-productive, such
as turning off all cuts with emphasis <code class="ph codeph">3</code>, but the user has the option if that is
what is wanted.</p>
