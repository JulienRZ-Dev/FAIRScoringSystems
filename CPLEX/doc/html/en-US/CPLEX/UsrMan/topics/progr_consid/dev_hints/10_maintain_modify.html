<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Suggests practices to facilitate maintenance and modification
of applications.</p>

<p class="p">Good programming practices save development time and
make an application easier to understand and modify. <a class="xref" href="02_tips_title_synopsis.html" title="In the previous chapters, you saw briefly the minimal steps to use the Component Libraries in an application. This section offers guidelines for successfully developing an application that exploits the IBM ILOG CPLEX Component Libraries according to those steps. These guidelines aim to help you minimize development time and maximize application performance.">Tips for successful application development</a> outlines
programming conventions followed in developing CPLEX. In addition,
the following programming practices are recommended.</p>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639696"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Comment your code</h2><p class="p">Comments, written in mixed upper- and lower-case, will
prove useful to you at a later date when you stare at code written
months ago and try to figure out what it does. They will also prove
useful to CPLEX team, should you need to send CPLEX your application
for customer support.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639698"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Write readable code</h2><p class="p">Follow conventional formatting practices so that your
code will be easier to read, both for you and for others. Use fewer
than 80 characters per line. Put each statement on a separate line.
Use white space (for example, space, blank lines, tabs) to distinguish
logical blocks of code. Display compound loops with clearly indented
bodies. Display <code class="ph codeph">if</code> statements like combs;
that is, align <code class="ph codeph">if</code> and <code class="ph codeph">else</code> in
the same column and then indent the corresponding block. Likewise,
it is a good idea to indent the body of compound statements, loops,
and other structures distinctly from their corresponding headers and
closing brackets. Use uniform indentation (for example, three to five
spaces). Put at least one space before and after each relational operator,
as well as before and after each binary plus (<code class="ph codeph">+</code> )
and minus (<code class="ph codeph">-</code> ). Use space as you do in
normal a natural language, such as English.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639700"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid side-effects</h2><p class="p">It is good idea to minimize side-effects by avoiding
expressions that produce internal effects. In C, for example, try
to avoid expressions of this form:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
a = c + (d =  e*f);  /* A BAD IDEA */
</code></pre><p class="p">where the expression assigns the values of <code class="ph codeph">d</code> and <code class="ph codeph">a</code> .</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639709"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Don’t change argument values</h2><p class="p">A user-defined function should not change the values
of its arguments. Do not use an argument to a function on the lefthand
side of an assignment statement in that function. Since C and C++
pass arguments by value, treat the arguments strictly as values; do
not change them inside a function.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639711"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Declare the type of return values</h2><p class="p">Always declare the return type of functions explicitly.
Though C has a “historical tradition” of making the
default return type of all functions <code class="ph codeph">int</code> ,
it is a good idea to declare explicitly the return type of functions
that return a value, and to use <code class="ph codeph">void</code> for
procedures that do not return a value.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639713"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Manage the flow of your code</h2><p class="p">Use only one <code class="ph codeph">return</code> statement
in any function. Limit your use of <code class="ph codeph">break</code> statements
to the inside of <code class="ph codeph">switch</code> statements. In
C, do not use <code class="ph codeph">continue</code> statements and limit
your use of <code class="ph codeph">goto</code> statements to exit conditions
that branch to the end of a function. Handle error conditions in C++
with a <code class="ph codeph">try</code> /<code class="ph codeph">catch</code> block
and in C with a <code class="ph codeph">goto</code> statement that transfers
control to the end of the function so that your functions have only
one exit point. </p>
<p class="p">In other words, control the flow of your functions so
that each block has one entry point and one exit point. This “one
way in, one way out” rule makes code easier to read and debug.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639715"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Localize variables</h2><p class="p">Avoid global variables at all costs. Code that exploits
global variables invariably produces side-effects which in turn make
the code harder to debug. Global variables also set up peculiar reactions
that make it difficult to include your code successfully within other
applications. Also global variables preclude multithreading unless
you invoke locking techniques. As an alternative to global variables,
pass arguments down from one function to another.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639717"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Name your constants</h2><p class="p">Scalars (both numbers and characters) that remain constant
throughout your application should be named. For example, if your
application includes a value such as 1000, create a constant with
the <code class="ph codeph">#define</code> statement to name it. If the
value ever changes in the future, its occurrences will be easy to
find and modify as a named constant.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639719"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Choose clarity first, efficiency later</h2><p class="p">Code first for clarity. Get your code working accurately
first so that you maintain a good understanding of what it is doing.
Then, after it works correctly, look for opportunities to improve
performance.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639721"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Debug effectively</h2><p class="p"> <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/C/26_data_cking.html#User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.651916__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.651832">Using diagnostic routines for debugging</a>,
contains tips and guidelines for debugging an application that uses
the CPLEX Callable Library. In that context, a symbolic debugger as
well as other widely available development tools are quite helpful
to produce error-free code.</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="User_manual.uss_developAppli.639688__User_manual.uss_developAppli.639729"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Test correctness, test performance</h2><p class="p">Even a program that has been carefully debugged so that
it runs correctly may still contain errors or “features”
that inhibit its performance with respect to execution speed, memory
use, and so forth. Just as the CPLEX Interactive Optimizer can aid
in your tests for correctness, it can also help you improve performance.
It uses the same routines as the Component Libraries; consequently,
it requires the same amount of time to solve a problem created by
a Concert or Callable Library application. </p>
<p class="p">Use one of these methods, specifying a file type of SAV,
to create a binary representation of the problem object from your
application in a SAV file. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex::exportModel</code> in
the C++ API</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <code class="ph codeph">IloCplex.exportModel</code> in
the Java API</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <code class="ph codeph">Cplex.ExportModel</code> in
the .NET API</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <code class="ph codeph">CPXwriteprob</code> in
the Callable Library (C API)</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><code class="ph codeph">cplex.model.write(“my_model.sav”)</code> in
the Python API</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Then read that representation into the Interactive Optimizer,
and solve it there. </p>
<p class="p">If your application sets parameters, use the same settings
in the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">If you find that your application takes significantly
longer to solve the problem than does the Interactive Optimizer, then
you can probably improve the performance of your application. In such
a case, look closely at issues like memory fragmentation, unnecessary
compiler options, inappropriate linker options, and programming practices
that slow the application without causing incorrect results (such
as operations within a loop that should be outside the loop).</p>
