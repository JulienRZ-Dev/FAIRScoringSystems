applies from May 25, 2018.</p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Why is GDPR important?</strong></p>

<p class="p">GDPR establishes a stronger data protection regulatory framework for processing of personal data
of individuals. GDPR brings:</p>

<ul class="ul" id="topic_dpr_gr1_x3b__ul_mfy_ps1_x3b">
<li class="li">New and enhanced rights for individuals</li>

<li class="li">Widened definition of personal data</li>

<li class="li">New obligations for processors</li>

<li class="li">Potential for significant financial penalties for non-compliance</li>

<li class="li">Compulsory data breach notification</li>

personal information. The data is used by CPLEX Optimization Studio for the purposes of finding
solutions to the optimization problem. The data is accessed using a database connector or from
files. It is not stored by CPLEX Optimization Studio.</p>

</li>

<li class="li">
<p class="p">Data written to log files by CPLEX Optimization Studio. These files do not contain personal
information.</p>

</li>

<li class="li">
<p class="p">Username and password data if a user connects CPLEX Optimization Studio either to the IBM Watson
Machine Learning service or to IBM ILOG CPLEX Enterprise Server. This username and password data can
be entered and deleted using the IDE.</p>

</li>

</ul>
