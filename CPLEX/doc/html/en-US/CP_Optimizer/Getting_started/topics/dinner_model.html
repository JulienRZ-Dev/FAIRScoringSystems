your development environment. This file is a program that is only
partially completed. You enter the missing code in each step in this
lesson. At the end, you will have completed the program code and you
can compile and run the program.</p>
<p class="p">In
this lesson, you include the header file <code class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</code>.
To catch exceptions that may be thrown, you use a <code class="ph codeph">try/catch</code> block.
The code for declaring an environment and a model, for calculating
the coaching pairs and for printing out the solution found by the
CP Optimizer engine is provided for you.</p>
<p class="p">First, you
represent the data of the program. The number of people, <code class="ph codeph">nbPersons</code>, is set to 60 in this example, but can
be easily modified. The number of teams, <code class="ph codeph">nbTeams</code>,
is 10 in this example. The size of a team, <code class="ph codeph">teamSize</code>,
is 6 in this example. </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
const IloInt nbPersons = 60;
const IloInt nbTeams = 10;
const IloInt teamSize = 6;
const IloInt nbServices = 6;

</code></pre><p class="p">As the teams and the slots in each team are
interchangeable, there is a lot of symmetry in this problem. To remove
the symmetry, you will use a two-step process to solve this problem
along with adding extra constraints. The first step is to determine
a set of integer tuples, such that each tuple represents a possible
set of new hires and existing employees to be assigned to a single
team with six slots. The second step is to select a feasible set of
ten of these tuples, one for each team, as the solution. </p>
<p class="p">The
first step requires solving a subproblem using CP Optimizer. Since
this subproblem is a constraint programming problem itself, you follow
the three step process to solve the subproblem.</p>

subproblem, you will search for all possible combinations for a single
team. There are 60 employees from six service units who can to be
assigned to a team of six people. The team must have three existing
employees and three new hires assigned to it. At most four people
from the same service unit can be on the team. If one person from
a coach/new hire pair is on the team, the other must be as well.</p>
<p class="p">The sixty people are labeled with unique identifiers in the
range 0 to 59. The existing employees are those with odd numbered
identifiers, and the new hires are those with even numbered identifiers.
The service unit memberships are the same as outlined in the description.</p>
<p class="p">Employees from Services A and B cannot be on a team together,
and employees from Services E and F cannot be on a team together.</p>

<li class="li"><p class="p">The unknown is all of the possible combinations
of employees that can be assigned to one team. In other words, there
are six decision variables, one for each slot. The domain of each

</ul>
<p class="p">What are the constraints on these variables?</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><p class="p">The team must have three existing employees

<p class="p">This subproblem is modeled and solved in the function <code class="ph codeph">MakeTeamTuples</code>, which returns an instance of <code class="ph codeph">IloIntTupleSet</code>. The tupleset is the set of all feasible
solutions to the subproblem. In this function, the code for creating
the environment and model for the subproblem and for filling the data
arrays <code class="ph codeph">newEmployee</code> and <code class="ph codeph">service</code>,
both indexed on the person identifiers, is provided for you. Each
element of the array <code class="ph codeph">service</code> states to which
service unit the associated person belongs, where the value 0 indicates
the person is an employee of Service A, the value 1 indicates the
person is in Service B, etc. The array <code class="ph codeph">newEmployee</code> is
a Boolean array; an element of <code class="ph codeph">newEmployee</code> has
the value 1 if and only if that person is a new hire.</p>
<p class="p">Each
tuple in the set to be returned has <code class="ph codeph">teamSize</code>,
or 6, elements. You create the <code class="ph codeph">IloIntTupleSet</code> using
the global environment that is the input argument to the function <code class="ph codeph">MakeTeamTuples</code>.</p>

To model the constraint that there must be an equal number of new
and existing employees on a team, you use an expression <code class="ph codeph">nbNewEmployees</code> to
count the number of new employees assigned to the array <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code>.
You use element expressions to determine if the person assigned to
each element of <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code> is a new employee
and use the self-assigned addition operator on the expression to find
the total number of new employees assigned to <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code>.
You constrain this expression to be equal to half the number of people
on the team.</p>

</code></pre><p class="p">To model the constraint that pairs must be
together, you constrain that each member of the pair be assigned to <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code> an equal number of times (in a later
step you will add a constraint that ensures each person is assigned
to <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code> at most once in any given
solution). You count how many times that person has been assigned
to elements of <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code> by using the IBM ILOG Concert Technology function <code class="ph codeph">IloCount</code>. To make sure that either both or neither
person in a pair is assigned to variables in <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code>,
you constrain that the number of times each person in the pair is
assigned to the array <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code> is equal.
Here you use the array <code class="ph codeph">coaching</code> which is
initialized in the main program such that the <code class="ph codeph">i</code>-th
element has the value of -1 if the <code class="ph codeph">i</code>-th
person does not have a coach or the identifier of the coach if the <code class="ph codeph">i</code>-th person has a coach.</p>

</code></pre><p class="p">To add the constraints on incompatible service
units and the maximum number of people from a service unit that may
be on the same team, you need to be able to represent the service
unit of each employee. To do this, you create an array of auxiliary
constrained integer variables <code class="ph codeph">serviceVar</code>,
which is indexed similarly to <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code>.
(For example, the third element of <code class="ph codeph">serviceVar</code> represents
to which service unit the person assigned to the third element of <code class="ph codeph">teamMembers</code> belongs. These variables are linked
using an element expression and the <code class="ph codeph">service</code> data
array.</p>

on the same team. To model this, you again use the IBM ILOG Concert Technology function <code class="ph codeph">IloCount</code>,
but instead of constraining the expression returned, you use it to
form the subconstraints of logical constraints. These logical constraints
state that the count of employees from either Service A or Service
B who are assigned to the team must be zero, and likewise for Services
E and F.</p>

to the submodel. Each solution is a valid assignment for one team.
As each solution is found, the assigned values are stored in an integer
tuple which is then added to the set of tuples that will be returned
to the main program. You create an integer tuple, or array, to temporarily
store each newly found valid team. You use an instance of <code class="ph codeph">IloCP</code> to find the solutions to the problem in the
model. Since you will need to find all solutions for this subproblem
instead of one solution, you will not use <code class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</code>,

that there is a solution.</p>
<p class="p">When solving a problem that

the optimizer, the function <code class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</code> searches
for a new solution in the search space. The function <code class="ph codeph">IloCP::end</code> cleans
