<p class="p">In this lesson, you include the

that may be thrown, you use a <code class="ph codeph">try/catch</code> block. The
code for declaring an environment and a model, calculating the unique
game identifiers and for printing out the solution found by the CP
Optimizer engine is provided for you.</p>
<p class="p">First, you represent the
data of the program. The number of teams, <code class="ph codeph">n</code>, is set
to a default of 10 in this example, but can be changed with an input
argument. (For this problem, the number of teams must always be even.
If the number of teams is not even, it is increased by 1.) The code

and slot.   To create the matrix of variables, you create an array
in which each element is an array of constrained integer variables.
The domain of values for each variable in <code class="ph codeph">games</code> is
the set of unique game identifiers; in this example the domain of
each variable is [0..89]. The matrix of variables <code class="ph codeph">games</code> will
represent the solution to the problem after a solution has been found
by the CP Optimizer engine.</p>
<p class="p">To help you model the constraints
that involve the home and away teams, it will be useful to be able
to easily determine which team is the home team and which team is
the away team for each slot. You declare auxiliary variables that
are not directly a part of the solution, but make it easier to model
the breaks and other constraints. You declare matrices of decision
variables which represent the teams that will play at home and away
in each slot, called <code class="ph codeph">home</code> and <code class="ph codeph">away</code>,
respectively. These matrices are indexed on week and slot in the same
manner as the matrix <code class="ph codeph">games</code>. The domain of the variables
in each of these matrices are the teams, represented by integers in
the range [0..9].</p>

To constrain the values assigned to a given slot of the matrices of <code class="ph codeph">home</code>, <code class="ph codeph">away</code> and <code class="ph codeph">games</code> variables
to be allowed combinations, you use the IBM ILOG Concert Technology constraint <code class="ph codeph">IloAllowedAssignments</code>.

as outlined in the description of the problem. The first set of constraints
state that each team can play in exactly one slot a week. For each
week, no team can appear twice in the set of variables representing
the teams playing at home and away for that week. In other words,
the home and away variables associated with a given week must all
be assigned different values in any solution. For each week, you create
an array with all of the home and away variables for that week. To
state that the value assigned to each decision variable in an array
must be different from that of every other variable in that array,
you use the IBM ILOG Concert Technology predefined constraint <code class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</code>.

a pair of teams must be in different halves of the season and also
must be at least six weeks apart (if there are fewer than 6 teams,
this minimum distance is reduced). To simplify modeling this constraint,
you create auxiliary variables to represent the week of the season
in which each game will be played.</p>
<p class="p">You create the array <code class="ph codeph">weekOfGame</code> which
is indexed on game identifiers. Each element of this array is a decision
variable with a domain of the possible weeks, [0..17]. The value of
each variable in this array represents the week in which that game
will be played. </p>
<p class="p">To ensure that the <code class="ph codeph">weekOfGame</code> variables
are assigned the appropriate values, you need to be able to determine
the week of each game. Assuming that each game is played exactly once,
the week that game <code class="ph codeph">g</code> is played is <code class="ph codeph">w</code>,
where there is an <code class="ph codeph">i</code> such that <code class="ph codeph">game[w][i]</code> is
assigned the value <code class="ph codeph">g</code>. To model this relationship,
you use two steps. First, you determine which slot a game has been
assigned to, then you determine the week of that slot.</p>
<p class="p">To determine
to which slot a game has been assigned, you create two arrays of decision
variables, each of length <code class="ph codeph">nbGames</code>. One is a “flattened”

The variables in <code class="ph codeph">allGames</code> are not new variables,
but provide an alternate view on the original variables in <code class="ph codeph">games</code>.
The other array,<code class="ph codeph"> allSlots</code>, is indexed by the games.
The domain of each variable in <code class="ph codeph">allSlots</code> is the set
of values of the indices of <code class="ph codeph">allGames</code>, [0..89]. Since <code class="ph codeph">allSlots[i]

breaks. No team can have a break of length three or greater. In other
words, in any sequence of three weeks, a team must play at least one
game at home and no more than two games at home. In order to count
the number of games at home in a sequence of three weeks, you create
a matrix of auxiliary variables indexed on team and week called <code class="ph codeph">playHome</code>.
The domain of each variable in this matrix is [0..1]. A value of 0
indicates the team plays away that week and a value of 1 indicates
that the team plays at home that week.</p>
<p class="p">To constrain each variable
in <code class="ph codeph">playHome</code> to be assigned the appropriate value,
you use the function <code class="ph codeph">IloCount</code>. You constrain the
value of the element of <code class="ph codeph">playHome</code> for that week and
team by counting the number of times that a particular team plays
at home during a particular week (it must be 0 or 1).</p>
<p class="p">For each
team, you represent each sequence of three games with a subarray of
the array <code class="ph codeph">playHome</code>. Using this subarray and the predefined IBM ILOG Concert
Technology function <code class="ph codeph">IloSum</code>, you can represent the
number of time the team plays at home during the three weeks.     </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p paragrouptitle">Addition expression  </p>
 <p class="p">Using the function <code class="ph codeph">IloSum</code>,
you can create an expression that represents the sum of the decision
variables in the array passed as an argument to the function. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">For
each team, you constrain the sum of each sequence of three <code class="ph codeph">playHome</code> variables
for each team to take the value 1 or 2. To do this, you use a <em class="ph i">range
constraint</em>.     </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p paragrouptitle">Range constraint  </p>
 <p class="p">A <em class="ph i">range
constraint</em> is useful when the value of a decision variable or
expression must fall between to values. In the C++ API, instead of
writing two separate constraints, one can be written in the form </p>
 <p class="p"><code class="ph codeph">lb &lt;=
exp &lt;= ub</code>, where <code class="ph codeph">lb</code> and <code class="ph codeph">ub</code> are
the bounds and <code class="ph codeph">exp</code> is the expression. </p>

are additional constraints that can be introduced to help improve
the search. The first set of additional constraints are called <em class="ph i">surrogate

used to <em class="ph i">reduce symmetry</em>.      </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p paragrouptitle">Surrogate constraint  </p>
 <p class="p">A <em class="ph i">surrogate
constraint</em> makes explicit a property that satisfies a solution
implicitly. In fact, in some disciplines, surrogate constraints are
known as implicit constraints for that reason. Such a constraint should
not change the nature of the solution, but its propagation should
delimit the general shape of the solution more quickly. </p>
 <p class="p"> In
any case where an implicit property makes good sense, or derives from
experience, or satisfies formal computations, its explicit implementation
as a surrogate constraint can be beneficial. </p>
 <p class="p"> Since constraint
propagation decreases the search space by reducing the domains of
variables, it is obviously important to express all necessary constraints.
In some cases, it is even a good idea to introduce surrogate constraints
to reduce the size of the search space by supplementary propagation.
 </p>
 <p class="p">Processing supplementary constraints inevitably slows down
execution. However, this slowing down may be negligible in certain
problems when it is compared with the efficiency gained from reducing
the size of the search space. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p"> It is known that a team
must play half of its games at home. This is already implicitly expressed
in the model within the set of tuples, so you are certain every solution
will satisfy this. However, adding an additional constraint on the <code class="ph codeph">playHome</code> variables
will improve the constraint propagation.</p>

apparent complexity of a problem can often be reduced to a much smaller
