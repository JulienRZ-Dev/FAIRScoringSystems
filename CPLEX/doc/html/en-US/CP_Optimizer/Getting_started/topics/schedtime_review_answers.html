<section class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedtime.119138__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedtime.146337"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Suggested answer</h2><p class="p">An interval has a start, an end, a size and a length.
An interval variable allows for these values to be variable in the
model. </p>
<p class="p">The length of a present interval variable is equal to
the difference between its end time and its start time. The size is
the actual amount of time the task takes to process. By default, the
size is equal to the length, which is the difference between the end
and the start of the interval. In general, the size is a lower bound
on the length.</p>
<p class="p">An interval variable may be optional. Whether an interval
is present in the solution or not is represented by a decision variable.
If an interval is not present in the solution, this means that any
constraints on this interval acts like the interval is “not
there.” Exact semantics will depend on the specific constraint.</p>
<p class="p">Logical relations can be expressed between the presence
statuses of interval variables, allowing, for instance, to state that
whenever the interval variable <code class="ph codeph">a</code> is present
then the interval variable <code class="ph codeph">b</code> must also
be present.</p>

when one interval variable must start or end with respect to the start
or end time of another interval variable.</p>
