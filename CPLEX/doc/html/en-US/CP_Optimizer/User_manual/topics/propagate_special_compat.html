<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Compatibility and incompatibility constraints can be used
to model difficult constraints and to improve solving efficiency.</p>

<p class="p">The compatibility constraint is a specialized constraint that is
defined by explicitly specifying the set of assignments that are solutions
to the constraint. </p>

<p class="p">Compatibility constraints are used frequently in constraint programming
applications. There are two broad categories of use: </p>

<ol class="ol">
<li class="li"><p class="p">when external data defines a constraint, and such a constraint
is difficult to state with arithmetic or logical constraints, and </p>
</li>

<li class="li"><p class="p">when you want to improve the efficiency of the solving process
by modeling a subproblem by assignments.</p>
 </li>

</ol>

<section class="section" id="migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerpropagate.1018955__migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerpropagate.1018967"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">External
data as constraints</h2><p class="p">In many constraint applications, it
is necessary to process a huge quantity of data. For instance, the
features of some products can be described as a relation in a database
or in text files. </p>
<p class="p">Consider as an example a bicycle factory
that can produce thousands of different models. For each model of
bicycle, a relation associates the features of that bicycle such as
size, weight, color, price. This information can be used in a constraint
programming application that allows a customer to find the bicycle
that most closely fits a specification. </p>
<p class="p">In the bicycle example,
illustrated here using the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong>, an array of decision variables <code class="ph codeph">x</code> is
defined, where <code class="ph codeph">x[0]</code> represents the identifier of
the bicycle, <code class="ph codeph">x[1]</code> its size, x[2] its weight, <code class="ph codeph">x[3]</code> its
color and <code class="ph codeph">x[4]</code> its price:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
    IloIntVarArray x(env, 5);

</code></pre><p class="p">A compatibility constraint on <code class="ph codeph">x</code> forces
the values of <code class="ph codeph">x</code> to be one of the combinations defined
in the tupleset: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
    model.add(IloAllowedAssignments(env, x, bicycleSet));

</code></pre><p class="p">where <code class="ph codeph">bicycleSet</code> defines the set of
solutions to the constraint as an <code class="ph codeph">IloIntTupleSet</code>:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
    IloIntTupleSet bicycleSet(env, 5);
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 1, 57, 12, 3, 1490));
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 2, 57, 13, 5, 1340));
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 3, 60, 14, 3, 1790));
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 4, 65, 14, 7, 1550));
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 5, 67, 15, 2, 2070));
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 6, 70, 15, 2, 1990));

</code></pre><p class="p">Another bicycle variable can be created by construction
another array of variables: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
    IloIntVarArray y(env, 5);

</code></pre><p class="p">The same compatibility constraint can be placed on <code class="ph codeph">y</code>: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
    model.add(IloAllowedAssignments(env, y, bicycleSet));

</code></pre><p class="p">It is important to note that tuplesets can be large,
and thus they are shared over compatibility constraints that use the
same tupleset. </p>
<p class="p">Here is a full example for illustrating domain
reduction achieved by this constraint: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
    IloIntVarArray x(env, 5);
    x[0] = IloIntVar(env, 0, 10);
    x[1] = IloIntVar(env, 40, 60);
    x[2] = IloIntVar(env, 10, 20);
    x[3] = IloIntVar(env, 5, 6);
    x[4] = IloIntVar(env, 1000, 5000);

    IloIntTupleSet bicycleSet(env, 5);
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 1, 57, 12, 5, 1490)); // tuple 0
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 2, 57, 13, 1, 1340)); // tuple 1
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 3, 60, 14, 5, 1790)); // tuple 2
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 4, 65, 14, 4, 1550)); // tuple 3
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 5, 67, 15, 2, 2070)); // tuple 4
    bicycleSet.add(IloIntArray(env, 5, 6, 70, 15, 5, 1990)); // tuple 5

    IloModel model(env);
    model.add(IloAllowedAssignments(env, x, bicycleSet));

    IloCP cp(model);
    if (cp.propagate())
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domains of vars = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(x) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    else
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Model has no solution." &lt;&lt; std::endl;

</code></pre><p class="p">Running this code produces the output:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
 Domains of vars = [[1 3] [57 60] [12 14] [5] [1490 1790]]

</code></pre><p class="p">There are only two possible solutions to the constraint
due to the domains of the variables in the array <code class="ph codeph">x</code>.
With the domain of <code class="ph codeph">x[3]</code>, only tuples 0, 2 and 5 are
possible. The domain of <code class="ph codeph">x[1]</code> eliminates the tuple
5. Thus the final domains are the union of the possible values in
the two remaining solutions. </p>
<p class="p">The forbidden assignments constraint
plays a symmetrical role: the tupleset represents the set of non-solutions
of the constraint. This is useful when there are fewer non-solutions
than solutions. </p>
<p class="p">Both constraints achieve full domain reduction
and do not support inference levels. </p>

<section class="section" id="migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerpropagate.1018955__migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerpropagate.1019055"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Improving
efficiency: a compatibility constraint for a subproblem</h2><p class="p">A
modeling trick that may dramatically reduce the computation time needed
to solve a problem consists in identifying a difficult subproblem,
computing all the solutions of the subproblem and storing them in
a tuple set and then creating a compatibility constraint.</p>
<p class="p">This
approach is not restricted to constraint programming but is a general
approach: facing a difficult problem, it can be easier to solve it
by: </p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><p class="p">decomposing the problem into subproblems, </p>
 </li>

<li class="li"><p class="p">solving the different subproblems and </p>
 </li>

<li class="li"><p class="p">connecting the solutions of the subproblems to produce a solution
to the whole problem. </p>
 </li>

</ul>
<p class="p">An allowed assignments constraint forces the values of the
variables of the problem to be one of the solutions of the subproblem.
Thus the connection of the solution of the subproblem with the remainder
of the problem is automatically handled. The advantage of this approach
is that when searching for a solution of the whole problem, instead
of always retrieving the solutions of the subproblem in the search,
the allowed assignments constraint forces values to one of these solutions.
In other terms, the work of solving the subproblem is factored and
done only once, before the search, and not several times during the
search (which is potentially a huge number of times). </p>
<p class="p">This
approach also has a drawback: the solutions of the subproblem must
be found first so this must be practical (the solutions should not
be too numerous). Allowed assignment constraints with several hundreds
of thousands of tuples can be handled, but subproblems with billions
of solutions cannot be handled in this way. Nevertheless, it is possible
to set a bound on the number of solutions of the subproblem to precompute
and store in the tupleset. In this case, the problem solved is a restriction
of the initial problem, but this may be useful in practice. </p>
<p class="p">An
example of such an approach is available in the file <code class="ph codeph">teambuilding.cpp</code> in
the <code class="ph codeph">examples/src/cpp</code> directory. </p>
