<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Presolve consists in modifying the model to improve it
so that it can be solved more efficiently. </p>

<p class="p">CP Optimizer presolves the input model before search. Presolve
consists in modifying the model to improve it so that it can be solved
more efficiently. </p>

<p class="p">Presolve works by</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">simplifying the model by reducing linear constraints by removing
redundancies and fixed expressions and</li>

<li class="li">strengthening the model to achieve more domain reduction by aggregating
constraints or factorizing common subexpressions.</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">Presolve can be helpful on models that are not well formulated
due to the model itself or to the model data.   The activation of
presolve is controlled by a parameter. In the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong>, the
parameter is <code class="ph codeph">IloCP::Presolve</code> which can be set to <code class="ph codeph">IloCP::On</code> (the
default) or <code class="ph codeph">IloCP::Off</code>. In the <strong class="ph b">Java™ API</strong>, the parameter is <code class="ph codeph">IloCP.IntParam.Presolve</code>.
In the <strong class="ph b">C# API</strong>, the parameter is <code class="ph codeph">CP.IntParam.Presolve</code>.</p>

<div class="p">As a consequence, the overall engine memory consumption can increase
because an internal model is created to perform the improvement operations.
The presolve transformations are displayed in the output log of CP
Optimizer. For example the line<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>! Presolve      : 6942 extractables eliminated, 158 constraints generated</code></pre>at
the beginning of the search shows that presolve as eliminated 6942
constraints or expressions and that a subset of constraints were aggregated
to 158 constraints.</div>
