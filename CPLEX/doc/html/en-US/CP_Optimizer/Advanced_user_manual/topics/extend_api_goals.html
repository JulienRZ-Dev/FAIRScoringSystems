<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Engine goals are used in the search.</p>

<p class="p">Goals are the building blocks used to implement search
algorithms in CP Optimizer. Both predefined search algorithms and
user-defined search algorithms can be expressed in CP Optimizer through
goals.</p>

<p class="p">Like other CP Optimizer entities, a goal is implemented
by two objects: a handle (an instance of the class <code class="ph codeph">IlcGoal</code>)
that contains a data member (the handle pointer) that points to an
implementation object (an instance of the class <code class="ph codeph">IlcGoalI</code> allocated
on the CP Optimizer heap).</p>

<p class="p">Among other member functions, the class <code class="ph codeph">IlcGoalI</code> has
a virtual member function, <code class="ph codeph">execute</code>, which
implements the execution of the goal. The <code class="ph codeph">execute</code> member
function must return another goal: the subgoal of the goal under execution.
If the execute member function returns 0 (zero), then no subgoal has
to be executed. </p>

<p class="p">A goal can either succeed or fail. A goal fails if a <code class="ph codeph">fail</code> member
function (such as <code class="ph codeph">IlcGoalI::fail</code>, for example)
is called during its execution. A goal succeeds if it does not fail.</p>

<p class="p">Goal execution is controlled by the member functions <code class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</code> or <code class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</code> and
implemented by a goal stack. The first time this member function is
called, it pushes all the goals that have been added to the invoking
optimizer onto the goal stack. Then it pops the top of the stack,
and if there is a goal there, it executes that goal. When the execution
of the current goal is complete, its subgoal is executed (if the current
goal has any subgoals). If there are no remaining subgoals, then the
next goal on top of the stack is popped. The member function next
stops when the goal stack is empty.</p>
